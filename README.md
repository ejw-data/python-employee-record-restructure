## Overview  
<hr>  
Short script used to practice extracting common work related personnel information into a more useable form and masking personal information that would not normally need to be seen by operations but yet still stored.  The data used by the script is a fake dataset.  


<br>


## Technologies    
*  Python

<br>


## Data Source  
This is a fake dataset that I found on the web.  No real personal information is contained in this repo.  I used this dataset to do a variety of testing including what is in this dataset which involves extracting general information and hiding personalized data such that users of the output data would not have sensitive information.
